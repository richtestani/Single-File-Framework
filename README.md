SFF: Single File Framework
--------------------------

Official Site: http://sffapp.com

To be fair it takes more like 3 files to make this work,
but most of the work is done in a single file,
and three file framework doesn't sound as
interesting.

What is SFF?
It's a simple site structure which helps
web developers quickly setup a website
based on either static text or dynamic.

The idea was based on a small problem
of having to get a handful of static
HTML files pulled together in a more
managable way and that helped me
provide a better URL structure for
the site.

The framework builds the pages based on the current URL
with a few extras sprinkled about such as URL rewriting,
routing and automatic including of files. SFF has
such a thing called plugins which are basically
any third party files you want to include in a project.

SFF also supports your own configuration files
and also loads them automatically.

I wanted to make the framekwork easy enough for
anyone with any level of experience to use it
and build on it anyway they want.

Documentaiton and better routing support
coming soon.
